title: My first blog post (for DSCI 521)

It has only been a few months since I had my first ever experience with Python and the endless capabilities that it brings. I took and introductory class that, unlike other intro courses, really made me passionate about Python. One of the most interesting uses of Python during the class was web-scraping. We were taught how to use Python packages like BeautifulSoup to navigate through an html webpage and scrape the information that we need. We then used the data that we scraped off and **attempted** to perform some machine learning concepts to predict the value of the scraped data for future dates. Notice how I bolded attempted? This is because I never actually got it to work. The professor offered the machine learning activity as an optional activity to our web-scraping project. At the time, I had little to no knowledge of how to perform anything remotely machine learning. Unfortunately, I still don't have any idea, and that is exactly why I am very excited for my studies in the MDS program. Hopefully with the help of the program, I will be able to learn how to use machine learning concepts on more use cases.
